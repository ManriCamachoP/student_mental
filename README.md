# Exploratory Analysis of Students' Diagnostic Test Scores

This project, led by Manrique Camacho on DataCamp, focuses on exploring and analyzing students' diagnostic test scores. The main objectives include counting records, categorizing scores by student types, and conducting a comprehensive analysis of diagnostic test scores.

## Project Overview

- **Data Exploration**: The project initiates with foundational steps, such as counting records and categorizing scores based on student types to discern variations among different categories.

- **Summary Statistics**: Aggregate functions are applied to compute summary statistics of diagnostic tests for all students, offering rounded scores for a comprehensive overview.

- **International Students Analysis**: The analysis is further refined to specifically summarize data for international students.

- **Final Query**: The final query, structured in PostgreSQL syntax but run on DataCamp, investigates the impact of the length of stay on average diagnostic scores for international students.

## Usage Instructions

1. Explore the iPython notebook provided in this repository, reflecting PostgreSQL syntax.
2. For successful execution, it's recommended to run the notebook in a PostgreSQL environment on DataCamp.

**Note**: The project's syntax is tailored for PostgreSQL and is suitable for review. Ensure compliance with DataCamp's environment for optimal execution.
